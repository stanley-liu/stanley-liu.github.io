					Hi! My name is Stanley Liu. I have a vested interest in leveraging my mechanical engineering background to make a difference in
					today's world. To make that goal a reality, I have also been experimenting with programming and software engineering in general - 
					this website is a byproduct of that! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the meantime, I am working as a Control Systems Engineer at Rolls-Royce Corporation in Indianapolis, Indiana, where I have
                    managed various investigations design changes on the AE engine platform to resolve issues occurring in our worldwide fleet.
					I have also interned at Collins Aerospace within Interiors to ensure travelers are comfortable and safe while flying, 
					and at Allison Transmission within Regulatory Compliance working on the next generation of hybrid automatic transmissions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of work, you can find me playing video games with my friends, following Formula One, cheering on my Pacers, Colts, and Boilermakers, playing on and learning musical instruments, spoiling our family cat, 
					or my favorite - traveling.
