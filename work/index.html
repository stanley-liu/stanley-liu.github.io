								<b>Control Systems Engineer</b>
								<br>
								I have managed various design changes on the AE engine line (AE 1107, AE 2100, AE 3007) arising from issues reported from engines operating in the fleet, providing growth in technical knowledge,
								project management, application of systems engineering principles, and communication with upper management. I have also frequently worked with MATLAB
								to analyze test data in verification and validation efforts. Additionally, I gained significant global working experience by regularly
								interfacing with Rolls-Royce plc. in the UK to coordinate the implementation of any necessary design changes.
								<br>
								<br>
								Outside of my engineering work, I serve as a board member of the Asian-Pacific Islander Association employee resource group to coordinate social events, and
								work with HR and various engineering managers to onboard new hires and interns.

								<b>Design Engineering Intern - Interiors</b>
								<br>
								I designed a concealed latch mechanism for a table stowage bin in order to meet Boeing and Airbus requirements and needs.
								Rapid prototyping methods were used to demonstrate proof-of-concepts of multiple iterations of the mechanism in a short period of time.
								<br>
								<br>
								I also re-designed electrical harness standoffs that were used to route electrical harnesses from the raceway on the main cabin floor up
								through the seat and to electrical components housed in the seat. These standoffs were easier to install and use, and were more than
								50% cheaper to manufacture than their purchased counterpart.
								<br>
								<br>
								Additionally, I worked on a project aimed at optimizing reliability and fatigue testing of aircraft seat backs to determine whether
								testing criteria could be lowered, therefore shortening testing duration.

								<b>Product Engineering Intern - Regulatory Compliance</b>
								<br>
								I worked on the Regulatory Compliance team to ensure hybrid transmissions demonstrated compliance with EPA and California Air Resources
								Board (CARB) regulations regarding emissions and diagnostic communication. This involved running emissions tests on a hybrid bus and conducting
								Production Vehicle Evaluation (PVE) testing. Within emissions testing, I also wrote a MATLAB script designed to analyze the validity of emissions test
								runs in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations.
								<br>
								<br>
								Additionally, I analyzed the digital logic design of Allison's hybrid transmission software to ensure documentation of OBD faults was accurate and up-to-date.
